# ServicePayment – Smart Contract for Service Payments

## 📖 Description  
ServicePayment is a smart contract written in Solidity (^0.8.24) that facilitates secure ETH payments between a **client** and a **service provider**. The contract holds the funds in escrow until the client confirms that the service was delivered. If the service is not completed within the agreed time, the client may request a refund.

This project is ideal for developers, freelancers, or businesses looking for a decentralized, trustless solution to manage one-time service payments on the Ethereum blockchain.

## ✨ Key Features  

- **Service Registration:** Clients define the service, provider address, and deadline.
- **Secure ETH Deposits:** Funds are locked in the smart contract upon service creation.
- **Payment Release:** The client releases funds to the provider after confirming service delivery.
- **Refund Mechanism:** Clients can recover their funds if the service is not confirmed before the deadline.
- **Basic Abuse Prevention:** Validations ensure confirmations or refunds cannot be abused or repeated.
- **Transparent Events:** All key actions emit events for on-chain tracking and auditability.

## 💼 Use Cases  

- **Professional services:** For designers, developers, writers, etc.  
- **Deadline-based contracts:** Time-sensitive agreements that require secure fund handling.  
- **Trustless payments:** Ideal for users who don’t fully trust each other.  
- **Lightweight freelance agreements:** No intermediaries or complex systems needed.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage  

### 🧱 Requirements  
- Solidity development environment (Remix, Hardhat, Truffle, etc.)  
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)  
- Ethereum network access (Remix VM, Goerli, Sepolia, or Mainnet)

---

### 📦 Deployment  
1. Open the contract in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and compile using version `0.8.24`.
2. Deploy it using the **Remix VM** or a testnet (e.g., Sepolia).
3. Interact with the contract through the Remix UI or a custom frontend.

### 💬 Interacting with the Contract  

#### 1. Create a Service (`createService`)
- Called by the **client**.
- Requires:
  - Provider address
  - Future deadline (as a Unix timestamp)
  - ETH value sent with the transaction
- Locks the ETH in the contract until confirmation or expiration.

#### 2. Confirm Service (`confirmService`)
- Called only by the **client**.
- Transfers the ETH to the **provider** upon successful confirmation.

#### 3. Request Refund (`requestRefund`)
- Called only by the **client**.
- Allowed only **after the deadline**.
- Refunds the ETH to the client if the service was never confirmed.
